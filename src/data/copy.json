It was the early 2000s, and every Saturday morning, our parents, drawn to Detroit by the promise of the auto industry, dropped us off to study Korean language and culture. We were the same age, and in a classroom full of kids wearing sparkly Limited Too tops, oversized Pokémon shirts, and Dragon Ball Z tees, we bonded over K-pop."},{"type":"text","value":"We’d meet at Minji’s house, where we’d sit cross-legged in the living room and play BoA’s “No. 1” on CD.  Later, when YouTube arrived, we’d crowd around her family desktop and watch BoA’s music videos, our eyes glued to the screen. We watched her on repeat - studying the way she moved, the precision of her choreography, and her cathartic vocals. We’d rewind the same eight-count over and over, trying to get it right. Sometimes we did. But most of the time we’d get it wrong, laugh, and hit play again."}],"speaker":"eunice","song":{"artist":"BoA","title":"No. 1","id":"no-1-boa"}}},{"type":"Text","value":{"text":[{"type":"text","value":"Modern K-pop is often traced back to the 1990s, when Seo Taiji and Boys – regulars at Moon Night, a club frequented by Black American GIs in Seoul – learned and took hip hop and New Jack Swing to Korean audiences. Their sound shook the music scene and sparked a cultural shift. In the years that followed, as the country recovered from years of political and financial crisis, the Korean government began to see pop culture - including music, television, and film - as a strategic export and form of soft power."},{"type":"text","value":"Of course, we didn’t know any of that at the time. It wasn’t “K-Pop”–it was just our everyday life. I remember my parents burnt CDs with their favorite Korean songs to bring a part of home with them before immigrating to Detroit. We would try to sing and rap along to Seo Taiji’s 난 알아요 (I Know) in the car, finding comfort in Korean words blasting in our ears as we drove through the Michigan suburbs."}],"speaker":"minji","song":{"artist":"Seo Taiji & Boys","title":"난 알아요 (I Know)","id":"i-know-seotaiji-and-boys"}}},{"type":"Text","value":{"text":"I remember the crowded church parties, the air thick with the smell of bulgogi and japchae. At a certain point of the night, the adults would bring out a bulky, personal Karaoke machine that someone had carried all the way from Korea and sing songs from the eighties and nineties. Our childhood drummed to this steady beat until 2006, when Minji’s family left for California and I moved to Korea the following year.","speaker":"eunice"}},{"type":"Image","value":{"src":"seo-taiji.png","shape":"rectangle"}}]},{"id":"second-gen","heading":"Growing Up — Our First Fandom","years":"2006–2012","nodes":[{"type":"Text","value":{"text":[{"type":"text","value":"My new school sat four miles from Koreatown and was predominantly Korean–a stark contrast from the majority White neighborhood I was coming from.

I was officially a fan.","speaker":"minji"}},{"type":"Text","value":{"text":[{"type":"text","value":"Around that same time, I also discovered Super Junior and felt the peculiar intensity of being obsessed with a boy band for the first time. I bought their CD, Twins, and inside was a fold-out sheet: each member serving face with their names printed underneath. It was implied you were supposed to pick a favorite. We didn’t call it a “bias” back then - that language hadn’t reached us yet. But for several years, mine was Kibum."},{"type":"text","value":"During this time, Minji and I were penpals, keeping in touch over email. One day she wrote that she was an ELF (Ever Lasting Fans, the official Super Junior fandom), and I screamed! It was thrilling to realize that we were both caught up in the same thing, in completely different places, and somehow it became another thread holding our friendship together."}],"speaker":"eunice"}},{"type":"Text","value":{"text":"But as the years went by, our tastes started to change.

I couldn’t believe that I was learning the choreography for SHINee’s “Replay” with my non-Korean friends, performing in front of an auditorium full of non-Korean classmates.

Louis the Child had released “It’s Strange” in 2015, and Chance the Rapper had come out with “Coloring Book” in 2016. These albums and other releases formed the soundtrack of my college years.","speaker":"eunice"}},{"type":"Text","value":{"text":"But even as my tastes changed, I could tell K-pop was gaining speed. My friends were saving money to go to KCON, a global K-culture festival, and I started to hear Korean songs play in the mall and on the radio.

My friends started stanning iconic groups like Red Velvet and BLACKPINK, and I found BTS. I dug through their then-discography of over 200 songs and made a (still-active) group chat with fellow ARMY friends. Together, we’d count down the days until the next comeback and undergo the impossible challenge of getting concert tickets, even making plans to travel across the country just to see them on tour.

When 2 members of the girl group (G)I-DLE (now i-dle) participated in the virtual group K/DA for the game League of Legends, and SM powerhouse group Aespa debuted with an AI and multiverse concept, I knew we had entered a new era.

We realized a lot had changed since we were dancing to BoA in her parents’ living room. The success of global groups like KATSEYE and XG are showing that the K-pop model may work without the “K” and in multiple markets.
